How to use for your own stickers
-------------
1. Clone or download ***ios-sticker-packs-app***.
2. Delete all resources in `Art Assets` in Xcode.
3. Add your own sticker images to the project.
4. Edit `stickerPacks.json` to include your own stickers.
5. Edit `about.txt` to include your app information.
6. **If you want Feedback submission**, follow [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12358002/submit-data-to-google-spreadsheet-form-from-objective-c) and edit `sendFeedbackAction:` in `MessagesViewController.h`.

####How to edit `stickerPacks.json`

`stickerPacks.json` is in JSON format. 

There are two keys in the root dictionary. 
`packOrder` is an array with order of the "packs" (categories). 
`allPacks` is a dictionary containing keys for each "pack". 
Each pack is a dictionary with a `order` key which is an array containing a dictionary for each sticker in that pack. 
`filename` is the filename of the sticker in your project.
`description` is the accessibility label for the sticker.

####Using APNG stickers

There are some non-obvious steps to using animated PNG (APNG) stickers in a iMessage App versus a no-code Sticker app.

- APNG must be under 500kb. Xcode processes images during build time and if your image is under but too close to 500kb, the image will be too big and the Apple sticker browser will not work correctly.
- APNG files must be imported with the `.png` extension. 
- Make sure the imported files have `MessagesExtension` selected for target membership.
